Part 2

(a) Python implementation

Here is the output for n = 10000:

    625 loops, best of 3: 1.11 ms per loop
   
(b) Cython implementation

Here is the output for n = 10000:

    625 loops, best of 3: 437 Âµs per loop
    
The implementation using Cython is about 2.5 times faster than the naive implementation.
